ιιο enomies oi the Carthaginians, they were sometimes taken prisonem
by the Carthaginiens, and then given up by the Carthagiuians to the
Romans on being demanded. When Demetrius held Attica with an

enemy with soldius, ships or provisions. And afterwards, iu 1627, a convention
was made between the lsings oi Sweden and oi Deumark, ιο ιιο effect that the
