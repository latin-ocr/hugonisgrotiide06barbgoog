VI. 1 As to the mede oi aeting in war, force and terror are tha
appropriate meane. whether it is allowable to use stratagem aleo, is a

lading was paid tor. But the Freueh, when Erench ships going to Spain were
oouiiseated by the English, shewed that they would not tolerate this. Therefore
we have rightly said that public declarations ars required And this the English
themselves saw the necessity ot. For they made such publio declaration in 1691
aud 1598, aa we see iu Camdeu.

Nor hare anch declaratione always bean oheyed, bnt times, anea, and places
have been made monada oi distinctions. In 1458 the oity oi Lubeclr refused to obey
a notice given to thena by the Dantzickers, that they ware netto hade with the
people oi bislmoge aad Memel. Nor did the llollanders lu 1651 obey, when the
Lubeokers gare theru notlce te abstain hom traffio with the Danas with whom
they were then at war. Iu the year 1622, when there was a war between Swedeu
aud Deumark, when the Danas had aslred the Hmseatte oities not to hare corn-
mercs with the swades, some oi the cities who had need oi their friendship cou-
formed to this, but others did not. une Eollsnders, when war was raging
between Sweden sud Poland‚ never allowed their eommerce with either uation ιο
be interdicted. The French always restored the Dutch ships which they took
either going oo or coming from Spain, theu st war with mem. See the pleading
oi Lonis Serrinus, held in loeo, in the ease ot the Hamburghers. Bnt the same
Dutch did not allow the English oo carry merchandise into Dunlrirls, before which
they had a fleet; sethe Dantzickers in 1166 did uot allow the Duteh to carry any·
thing into Kdnlgsberg. [See tha authorities.
