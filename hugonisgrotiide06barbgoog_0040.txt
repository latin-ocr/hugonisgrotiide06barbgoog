2 Therefore Cato the Censor was not guilty of a lie when he falsely
promised assistance ιο bis allies; nor Flaccus, who related ιο others
that the enemy's city was taken; though the enemy was thus de·
ceived; and Plutarch relatas a similar act of Agesilaus. For in
these cases nothing was said to the enemy: and the damage to them
which followedis extrinsie to our act, and isin itsclf not unlawful te

the discourse of Paul, in which ιι Antioeh he reprehended Peter as
