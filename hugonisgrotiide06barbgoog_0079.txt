68 DE BELLA JUSTO swa SOLENNI JURE [Luam.

praedones, neque in co quod rex gerit in subditos locum

aq ιι a habent Ideo Seneca distincte dixit: indicta bella finitimis,
cut qesta cum civibus

,msa ΧΠ. Nam quod notant quidam et exemplis docent,
etiam in bellis talibus capta fieri capientium, rerum est, sed
ex una dumtaxat parte, idque ex jure naturali, non ex jure
voluntario gentium, ut quod gentibus tantum prospicit, non his

gaasar quisine gente sunt, aut pars gentis. Errant et in ee, quod
putant bellum sui tuendi aut rerum tuendarum ergo suscep-
tum indictione non egere: nam eget omnino. non quidem
simpliciter, sed ad eos quos dicere ecepimus, et mox explicabi-
mus, effeetus.

XIlI. Ne illud quidem rerum, non statim atque indic-
tum est inferri bellum posset quod Cyrus in Armenios, Ro-
mani in Carthaginienses, ut modo diximus, fecerunt Nam
indictio nullum post se tempus jure gentium requirit. Potest
tamen fieri, ut ex naturali jure tempus aliquod requiratur ex
negotii qualitate, puta cum res repetitae sunt, aut prena in
nocentem postulata, et id negatum non est. Tunc enim id

the two peoples or their heads: for from this public character arise
peculiar effecta, which do not take place either in a war carried on
against pirates, or in one which a king makes against his subJeets.
And so Seneca speaks with a distinction, of war declared against ncipit-

boara, or carried ca against our own citiam ¹

XII. For what some remark and illustrate by examples, that
ewen in such wara, what rs captured becomes the property of the cap·
tore rs true, but on one side only, and that by Natural Low, not by
the instituted Law of Nations; since that regards only natione and
their dealings with natione, not those who are without nation, or are
only part οι a nation. They err in this, that they think that a war
undertaken for tho purpose of desending one’s sels or one’s property,
does not need to be preceded by a declaration of war; for it by
all means necds such an introduction: not indeed simply, but for
tho sake of leading to the effecte wa have already partly explained, and
shall explain further.

Xlll. Nor is it true even that a war may not bo beguu immedi-
ately aiter it has been declarcd: which Cyrus did in Armenia, and
the Romans towards tho Carthaginiens, as we have already said. For
a declaration cf war does not, by the haw of Nations, require any
definite timo after it. But it may be requisita that, by Natural
Low, some time may be required, in consequence of the quality of
'thc business: as sor instance, if property is required to be restored,
