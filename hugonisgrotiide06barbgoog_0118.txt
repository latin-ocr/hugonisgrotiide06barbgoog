(las. v1.] DE JURE AOQUIRENDI BELLO CAPTA. 107

sua pietate, semper improbarit, ut videro est Gen. xxxiv. 30;
xlix. 6.

2 Probatum autem aDeo jus praedae inter eos quos dixi
naturales terminos aliis quoque locis apparet. Deus in lege
sua, decivitate post pacem repudiatam expugnata loquens, sic
ait: Omnia q’as spolia diripiea tibi: et stuata prada hoe· Ma ιι
tiam, qaam tibi Deua dederit. Rubenitae, Gaditoe, et pars
Manassitarum dicuntur vicisse Ituraeos eteorum vicinos, mul-wama
tamque praedam ab iis abstulisse, hac ratione addita, quod in m
bello Deum invocassent, et Deus eos propitius exaudiisset:
quomodo et rex pius Asa narratur, Deo invocato, de AEthiorrarasuv·
pibus, injusto bello se lacessentibus, et victoriam et praedam ΠΜ
reportasse: quod eo magis notandum, quia arma illa nou ex
speciali mandato, sed ex communi jure sumebantur.

3 Josue auteur eosdem quos dixi Rubenitas, Gaditas‚ et 10¹- rub·t
Manassis partem secundis ominibus prosequens: participes,
inquit, sitis prodo hostiam cumfratribus cecide. Et David,
curn ad Senatores Hebraeos mitteret parta de Amaleoitis spolia,

Lib. 1. esp. x. 5 2. dicia Hude.) et qne tur id iactum precibus ad Deum, qul

2 That the right of taking booty within the natural boundaries
which I hare mentioued was approved by God, appears from other
places also. God, in his law, speaking of a city taken after it bad
refused peace, says, Deut. xx. 14: All the apcil thereos cheli those take
to thyrelsr and thou stult cat the rpoe'l os thiae mmier which the
Lord thy (iod harh picen thee. Sol Chronr. 20, the Reubenitea
Gaditas‚ and hali tribe of Manasseh, made war upon the Hagarites
and their neighbours‚ sud took much spoil; there being added as a
remon, that they cried to God in the battle and ho was entreated of
them. Also 2 Chron. xiv. 13, the picus king Asa is related to have
eried unto the Lord, and to hare conquered the Ethiopians who
attached blm unjustly‚ and to have carried away very much spoils
whichis themora to be noted, because in that case arms were not
taken up by a special mandate, but on the pound of the common
Laws oi Nations.

3 Also Joshus, (xxii 8) when he sent away the Reubenites, and
blessed them, said, Dioide the spoil ‹y‘yoar eoemies with your breihren.
And David, (1 Sam. xxx. 26) when he sent to the Hebrew elders
part of tho spoil of the Amalekitcs, said, Behold a presan to you os
the epoti cs the semies astte Lcrd. Indeed as Seneca says, it is a
gruceful thing lor a military man to enrich a friend with the spoil oi
