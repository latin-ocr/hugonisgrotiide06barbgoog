XX. l But not only have different usages prevailed in different
wara, int in the mmo war the same hooty hae often been applied to
different uses, either by diriding it into parts, or by distinguishing
the lrlnd of objecta Thus Camillus dedicated the tenth part of the
spoil to Pythian Apollo, following the example of the Greeks, which
however, came originally from the Hebrews= and at that time, the
dedication of a tenth of the spoil was held hy the priests to include,
not moveahles only, bnt the landa and the city. By the same gene·
rel, when victorious over the Falisci, the greater part of the hooty

was messenen ιο the questor, and a small part only given to the
soldiers. So 1.. Manlius, aaa sold tho φοι, raas parc osii which was

theses men, captives, herde and fioclss, which the Greeks, when they
speak strictly, eall λείας money and other moveables, either prociona
or common. Q. Fabius, when he had conquered the Volsci, ordered
the λεια and spoils to he sold by the questor3 he himself managed
the money. The same, when the Volsci and AEqui were conquered,
gave to the soldiers the captives, except the Tusculanae and in the
land of Ecetra, gave up men and cattle ιο piliage. L. Cornelius,
