service in the army. Thus also the soldiers of Alexander had for
their use the booty taken from prira‘te persons, except that there was

and accordingly, we find that those who were said te have conspired
at Arbele, were aceuscd of intending to appropriate the whole cf the
spoil, and to gire nothing to the treasury.

4 But what had been with the enemy, public property cr king's
property, was exempted from this licence. Thus we read that the
Macedonians, when they stormed the camp of Darius at the rirer
Pyramus, plundered a great mass cf gold and silver, and left nothing
untouched except the king's tent: ecemrtinp to tle established moos,
says Curtius, thot tte conquered party should receive tte conqueror r'n
tlte ktcp’s tent. And the usage of the Hebrews was not different, who
put the crown cf the conquered king on the head of the conqueror,
and assigned to him (es we read in the Talmudic Collections) the
royal furniture which was taken in the war. So, in the history of
Oharlemngne, we read that when he had conquered the Hungarians,
the privato treasure went to the soldiers, the royal, to the treasury.
Anmng the Greeks there were two different words for public and
priests spoil, λάφυρα and σκῦλα. The latter implies what was taken
