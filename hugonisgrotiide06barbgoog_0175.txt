by the Thebans3 which sum Alexander tho Great, haring conquered
Thebes, gave to them by the right of victory3 nor is that truc which
is alleged for tho Thebans in Quintilian: that that only belongs to the
victor which he himself has ln his handa; and that an incorporoal right
cannot so bc taken possession of: that the condition of an heiria
different from that of scriotor, boccum to the former the right passos,
to tho latter the thing only. For hc who is lord of the persons, is lord
of the things also, and of all things which belong to the person. He
who is in the possession of another, has no possession for himself3 and
he who is not his own master, can be master of nothing else.

3 livea if any victor leave to the conquerad people tho rights of
their state, ho may take to himself some things which belonged to tha
state: for it depends on his own will what limit hc chooscs to lix to the
benefits which hc gives. Cesar imitated the act of Alexander, in re·
mitting to the Dyrrachium tho debt which they owed to some of the
adverso party. But here it might bc objected that the war of Cesar
was not of that kind for which this law of nations was established.
