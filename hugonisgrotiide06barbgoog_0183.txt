puli pacati, siout factum pro jure secuti erant in capto, ita
et in liberato, ut se aequos praebeant utrique parti. Ergo
dominium quod habuerat in res ejus is, qui belli jure eum
possidebat, non erat sine omni conditione: cessare enim po-

noted by Florentinus. The same follows if he be spontanccnely given
up by the enemy.

But what is tha result if he be sold by the enemy in tha usual
way of treffic, and so como to his own people? This controversy ia
treated by Quintilian, with reference ιο ιιο Olynthian, whom Parrha·
sius had bought. For a decree having been made by the Atheniens
that the Olynthiana should be free, ha enquires whether this moene
that they should become free, or should be adjndged to be free: of
which the latter is the more true opinion.

· VI. 1 Moreover a free man, after he has returned ιο his own
people, acquires, not only himself, but all the property which he had
in a nentral State, both corporeal and incorporcal. For the neutral
State, as they took the fact for law in the case of captivity, must do
tho same in the caso of liberation, to shew themselves impartial ιο
ιοιι parties. Therefore the right, which he who possessed him by
the law of war, had over his property, was not altogether without con·
ditione: it was linblo to cease without his consent, if ιο who had been
captivs made his way to his own people. He therefore loses the pro-
perty, os ha loeas the man ιο whom it was an necessary.

2 But what if he had alienated this property? Will he who de·
rives his title from him who, at the timo, was owner, by the right of
war, bc safe by the law of natione 3 or may the property be recovered
