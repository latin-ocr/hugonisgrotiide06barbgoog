imperio. At si ipsa multitudo qum civitatem constituerat dis-
soluta sit, serius puto non eundem populum censeri, nec post·
liminio res restitui ipso gentium jure, quia populns, ut naris,
partium dissolutione plane interit, eo quod tota ejus natura in
illa perpetua conjunctione consistit. Non ergo quas luerat
Sagunti civitas οοᾱοοι exstitit, cum veteribus cultoribus ea
sedes octavo post anno restituta est: neque Thebae, cum jam
Thebani in servitutem ab Alexandro veniissent Hine appa·
ret quod Thessali Thebanis debuerant, non esse Thebanis
postliminio restitutum: idque duplici de causa: tum qnod
novus erat populus, tum quod Alexander, quo tempore domi-

creditum non in eorum est numero qum postliminio redeunt.

of their enemies. But if the multitude which had constituted the
state or city be dissolsed, 1 conceive it to be more true that it is not to
bc rechoned the same people‚ and that their condition isnot restored
by postliminium, by the law of nations: for a people, like aship, by the
dissolutiones its parts, perishes outright; since its whole nature con-
sists in the continuity of its composition. And therefore that which
had been the city of Saguntum was no longer the same city, when the
same place was restored to theold inhabitants eight years later: nor
was Thebes the same city when the Thebans had been sold as slaves
by Alexander. Hence it appears that what tho Thessaliam owed the
Thebans was not restored to the Thebans by postliminium, and that,
for two reasons: bedaum it was a new people; and muse Alexander
could and did alienate this right; and because a creditis not ot the
number of the things which return hy postliminium.
