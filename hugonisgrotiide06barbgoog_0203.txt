nites, in Livy, give up what they had taken3 which they say, nomed

careby tte nieht os war: med, because the war was unjust, as tha
Samnites had confessed.

2 It is a cese of the same kind, that an unaqual contract, made
without deecit, gives, by the Lavv of Nations, a right of compelling tha
iulhlment ot tha compaets; and yet he who has the advantage, isbound
by the duty oi an honest and picus man, ιο reduce it ιο equality.

Vl. 1 But also, he who has not caused any demago, or hus
caused it without any fault, but who has in his possession a thing
talen in vvar from another, is bound to restore it, because tharsis no
causo, naturally just, why the other should be deprived of it; not his
consent; not his ill dasem not compensatiou. There is a story to
this effect in Valerius Maximust When P. OEuudius bod takes oud
sold tlte people os Camerina, although tite moreey aad the οοοοιωοι were

the Romans, the Phocenses had their liberty and land restored. So
the Ligurisns who had been sold by M. Popilius, were redesmcd and
restored to liberty, aud their property given back. So with regsrd
to tho Abderites, the Senatu decrood the same thing, adding the reason,
that the war had been unjust.

npon it, may deduct as much as it vas worth to the owner tc recover
