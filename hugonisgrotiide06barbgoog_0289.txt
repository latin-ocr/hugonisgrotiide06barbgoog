act, he will not do rightly.

2 The snswer which was giren by illustrious jurists, respecting a
slave who, captured by robbers, had afterwards mode his way to the
enemy, [and was then captured from them, and exposed for sale.
Grecos] namcly, that it was true, that he had hcen stolen, and that
his haring been in the hands of tho enemy, or haring returned by
postliminium, was no obstacle to that wiew3 is the samo answer which
we must give respecting him who, being captured in an unjust war,
afterwards by just war, or in any other way, comes into the possession
of another: for in internul justice, an unjust war does not differ from
a robbery. And to this effect responded Gregory of Neocesarea,
being consultod in reference to the case, when certain men of Pontus
had received into their possession property of the citizens captured
by barbaricus.

it was talem eud we see that this has often been done. Livy, after
mentioning that tho Volsci and Equi were conquered by L. Lueretius
