aut summum inbelle arbitrium habent, aut publiea
imperia exequuntur. Videndum etiam quid privatim in bello
liceat, qua naturae, qua divino, qua gentium jure. Narrat

Cicero relatos that Cato’s son served in the army of Pompilius
tili his legion was dismissed: that he theu remained with the army
as a volunteer: and that Cato wrote to Pompilius, that if he wanted
ιο keep him in the army, he must make him taire the military cath
agaim because the former cath being cancelled, he could not law·
fully light with the enemy. He adds also the very words of Oatc's
letter ιο his son, warning hIm netto take part in the fighting. Sc
we read that Chrysas, a soldier cs Cyrus, was praised, because, whcn
he had raised his swerd ιο οιιι down an enemy, hc lowered it cn
hearing the signal for a retreat. Sc Seneca.
