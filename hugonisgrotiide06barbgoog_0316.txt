Gar. XIX] DE FIDE INTER HOSTES. 309

VI. Quid dicemus de subditorum bellis adversus reges
aliasque summas potestates? his, etiamsi eausam per se non
injustam habeant, jus tamen per vim agendi deesse ostendimus
alibi. Potest interdum et unta esse ant cansa injustitia, ant meaa
resistendi improbitas, ut puniri graviter possit. Tamensi
quasi eum desertoribus ant rebellibus actum sit, poena pro·
misso opponi non potest, secundum eaquae modo diximus.
Nam et serris iidem servandam veterum pietas existimavit,

credito Lacedaemonios iram divinam expertos, quod Taenaren· fflffier·

ses serres contra pacta occidissent. Et Diodorus Siculus no- blatii&
tat fidem servis datam in fano Palicorum nunquam a quo·
quam domino inisse violatam. Metus antem illati exceptio et
hie poterit elidi interposito jurejurando, sicut ⁸ M. Pomponius
tribunus plebis jurejurando obstrictus servavit, qnod L. Manlio
metu coactns promiserat.

VII. Sed hic supra priores specialem difficultatem iacit
jus legis constituendae et jus supereminens dominii in res snb-
ditorum quod civitati competit, et ejus nomine a summam po-

nations have agreed ιο overlook what is done against theim even by
siciens acts.

VI. What shall we say oi the ware oi subjecta against kings and
other supreme authorities? That these, ewen when they have a cause
in itself not nujust, still have not the right of acting by force, we have
shown elsewhere. But sometimes, in such cases, the injustiee oi the
cause, or the wickadness of the resmtnnce, may be so great, that it may
he liable to heavy punishment. And yet ii a treaty be conducted with
personans with deserters or robbers, such liability cannot be opposed
to the promise, as we have just said. Even ιο slaves, saith must be
kept, according to the piety oi the ancients3 and it was believed that
the Lacedaemoniam were visited by the divine anger, because, con·
trary to convention, they had put te death the Taenarians, who were
slaves. And it is noted by Diodorus, that saith pledged to a slave in
the temple oi the Palici was never violated by a master. And the
exception oi ienr imposed, may here aleoba cancelled by interposing
an eath; as M. Pomponius, tribune oi the pcople‚ under the obligation
of an oath, kept the promise which 1.. Manlius had made under fear.

VII. But beyond these difficulties a special difficulty arises from
the right which the State possessas ιο make lawe, and from its right oi
