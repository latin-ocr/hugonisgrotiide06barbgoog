jurando obstrictam tenet. Romani hoc genus hleges sacratas
appellabant, per quas ipse populus Romanus, ut Cicero pro [[αν- lai]
Balbo explicat, religione obligabatur.

2 Est ad hane rem pertinens disputatio per se obscurior
apud Livium libro tertio, ubi ex sententia multorum juris in·
terpretum ait tribunos esse sacrosanctos, non etiam aediles,
judices, decemviros, quorum tamen si cui noceretur id non
jure fieret. Causa discriminis est, quod aediles atque alii lege
sola defendebanturt quod autem postremum populus jussisset
id ratum erat, manente tamen lege nomini contra agere jus
erat: at tribunos religio publiea populi Romani tuebatur: nam
jusjurandum intercesserat, quod ab his ipsis qui juraverant
salva religione tolli non poterat. Dionysius Halicarnassensis

for the sake of publio utility. For the state may give up what is
clearly its own, and the words may be so plain ae to allow no excop-
tion. Valerius Maximus says to the Atheniens, Reod tle Low to which
you ere bound by cuth. 'l'he Romans called such lawe lepos somate:
and by such, the Roman people itself, as Cicero for Balbus explains,
was in conscience bound.

2 There is a somewhat obscura dissertation on this subject, iu the
third Book of Livy, in which he says that, according to the opinion of
many jurleta, the tribunes were sacrosante, but not the ediles, judges‚
decemvirs3 though if harm was done te any of them it was unlawful.
The oausaof the differenco ia, thatthe ediles and others were defended
bytho law ouly; aud while the law lasted, no one might aet against
it3 but the tribunes were defended by the public religione engage-
ment of the Roman people: for au ooth had been administered,
which those who had taken it could not set asido with a saie con·

men condemned the act of Tiberius Gracchus, when ho abrogated the
