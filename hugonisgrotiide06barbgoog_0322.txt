’ XIV. But at the same time it ιι ιο be remarlred, that there are
two ways in which the promicet may be blameless οι pertidy, though
he does not perform what he had promised3 namely, by deieot οι the
condition, and by compensation.

By defeat οι condition, the promiser ia not truly liberated from a
promise, but the event shows that there was no obligation, since it wne
contracted only under the condition. And to this head ιι ιο be
referred the oasa in which the other party has not fuldlled what, οιι
his part, ho was bound to iulfil. For in a contract οι that kind, each
article implies the atheraim the way οι οοιιιιιιιοιις as ιι ιι hed been
expressed by saying, I will do ιο and ιο ιι tho other doce what he has
promised. So Tullus, answering the Albana, says that he calis the
gods to witness that, Wtiohecer pcople shall first ircim aad ἆιιιιιιιι ιιι
amhasradore who como aad ιιι sor rectituticn, on it ιιιιιι sall all ιιι
ιαιιιιιιιιιι os ιιι war. Ulpian says, He ιιιιοι ιο ιι held as ιιι ally who
renounced ιιι treaty decem some canona oo which the alliam was
aaran ιο was not performed. On this account, ιι the intention οι the
treaty bc different from this, it ιι usually clearly expressed, that ιι
anything be done contrary ιο this or that part, the other parts still
remnin ralid.
