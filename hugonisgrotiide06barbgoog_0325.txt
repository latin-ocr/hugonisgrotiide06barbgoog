318 ΒΕ FIDE INTER HOSTES. [hle. III.

quod promissum est opponi lite manente non poterit, aut actio
de qua lis erat, aut litis dsmnae et impensae, ita nec manente
bello compensari poterit aut id uude ortum est bellum, aut
quidquid bellico gentium jure fieri solet N egotii euim natura,
ne nihil actum sit, ostendit convenisse sepositis belli contro·
versiis: nam alioqui nulla esset pactio quae non posset eludi:
nec iorte male heo aptem quod tapud eundem, quem jam lau·
davi aliquoties, Senecam est: Nullam asserionem recepe·
runt (majores) et homines scirent fidem utiquc praetendens
Setius caim erat a paucis etiam justam accusationem non
accipi, qaam ab omnibus aliquam tentari.

2 Quae ergo sunt quoe compensari cum so quod promis-
sum est poterunt? nimirum si quid alter, quamvis ex alio
contractu, inter bellum inito, debet: si damnum dedit intra
induciarum tempora: si legatos violavit, aut aliud quid iecit
quod inter hostes jus gentium damnat

between the two parties to a lewsuit, thoy cannot, during the suit, set
against what was promised, either the original ground oi action, or
the loss and expense of the suit; so while the war goes on, we οιιιιιιοι
bring into the balance, either the original ground oi the wer, or any·
thing which hes resulted from the exorciso of the usual belligerent
rights. For tho nature of the business shows that the convention, in
order thet it may not bo without any effect, must have been made
setting asido tho controversies belonging to the wer iteeli. For other-
wiso there could be no convention which might not be eluded. To
this we may epply a passage of Seneca: [which honoreris notrery
closely to the purpose. W.]

2 What then are tho matters, which maybe balanced against that
which was promised? This ior instance; if the other, though irom
another contract, mede during the war, owes us a dcbt; or if he have
committed damage duringa tirno of truce; or if he have violated the
rights of ambassadors; or done anything else which the Law of Na·
tiens condemns as between enemies.

3 But it is to be observed, that compensation must take place
between tho same persons who are so bound to each other, ond so
that the right oi a third party be not injured; but still, so that tho
goods of subjecte are understood to be bound ior what tho stete owes,
as we hare elsewhere said.

4 We must add this also ; thet it is the part oi agenoreus mind
