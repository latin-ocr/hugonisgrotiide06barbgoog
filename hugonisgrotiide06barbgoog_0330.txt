intellect, cauum make peace. The same is to be said oss king in
captivity, provided he received his sovereignty from the people; ior
it is not to be supposed that they would bestow the power, to be
used by a person who vus not free. Hence, in this case, the sove-
reignty, not indeed as to its whole rights, but us far as exercise aud
guardiensbip, will be with the people, or him to whom the people
commite it.

2 But as to things which belong to himself, if a king, evcn in
captivity, make any compact, it will be vnlid, according to the example
of private couventionem* which wehuve spoken. But it' the king bean
exile, cau he make peace? Yes, if he is under uo constraiut3 other·
wisc, his condition differs little irom that of a captive: for the custody
of a cuptive is often lax. Regulus refused to deliver his opinion in
the Senate, ssying that so long as he was under an cath to the
enemy, he was not a senator.

IV. In au aristocratical or democratical state, the right of muk-
ing troaties will be with the maj0rity‚ respectively, of the Couucil, and
of the Assembly of citizens who have a vote, as we have elsewhere

said. Thereiore conventione so made, biud them also who dissented·
