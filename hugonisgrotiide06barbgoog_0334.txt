nomen et ipse, qui damnum passus est, si opus est, contri·
huet. Neque hcc onere levabitur civitas, si nunc forte ei
praestationi par non sit,¹ sed quandocumque eopia suppetit,
exseret sese quasi sopita obligatio.

Vlll. Neque illud indistinete admitto, quod dicit Ferdi-
nandus Vasquins, agnoscere civitatem non debere id damnum, ιιιιιωιι
quod jam bello datum est, eo quod jus belli talia permittat. 'amm'
Nam jus illud belli populos ahos spectat, ut alibi exposuimus: {hilm
partim et hostes inter ss, non cives inter ss, qui oum socii

sint aequum est ut eommunia habeant damna, quae societatis ἐπῃ-

eausa contingunt. Plane civili lege et hoc constitui poterit, ”mals
ut rei bello amissa causa nulla adversus civitatem aetio sit,
ut sua quisque acrius defendat.
IX. Sunt qui latum discrimen collocant inter ea, quae
civium sunt ex gentium jure, et ea quae eorundem sunt ex
jure civili, ut in hac jus laxius regi concedant, etiam auferendi
sins eausa et compensatione, in illa non item: perverse: nam
dominium ex qualicunque eausa ortum sit, suos semper effeetus
habet ex ipso jure naturali, nt scilieet auferri nequeat nisi ex

bound to make good the loss ιο ιιοιι vrbo lose their property3 aud
to this public purpose, among otbers, he who has suffered the loss
must, if need be, contributa. Nor is the state relieved from this
onus, if, for the present, it be unable to discharge it; but at any future
time, when the means are there, the obligatior which had been sus-
pended revives. -

VIII. Nor do I admit, without distinetIon, what Vasqnius says;
that the state is not bound ιο aekuowledge the damage which is
inflicted by war, because the right cf war permits such damage. For
that right of war bas regard ιο other peoples, as we bave elsewhere
explained3 and, partly at least, affecte enemics in their mutual rela-
ιιοιιι, not citizens iu theirs; for since these are socialiy bound toge-
ther, it lsjust that they bear in common the losses which happen for
the sake of society. It may however be established by the civil
law, that a thIng lost in war shall not gIve a citizen a right of reeo-
very against the State3 in order that each person may themora
strenuously defend bis own property.

IX. There are some writers who make a broad distinction be-
tween things which belong to the citizens by the Law oi Nations, and
things which belong to them by the Oivil Laws ιο that with regard to

the former, they allow a looser right to⁶the¹ king, so that he may take
them without cause and without compensation3 but not so with regard
ιο the latter. Wrongly. For ownership, from whatever causo it
