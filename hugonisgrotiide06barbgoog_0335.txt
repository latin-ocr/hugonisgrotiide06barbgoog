X. Sed haeo inspectio, ne nisi ex publiea utilitate res
privatorum concedantur, regem spectat et subditos, ut illa de
damm sarciendo ciuitatem et singulos. Nam externis, qui
cum rege contrahunt, sufficit lactum regis, nou tantum ob
praesumtionem quam secum adfert dignitas personae, rerum
etiam ob gentium jus, quod bona subditorum obligari ex laeto
regis patitur.

XI. 1 Circa interpretandas paeis conventiones observan-
dum est quod supra anobis est traditum, quo quidque plus
habet favoris, eo laxius accipiendum quo longius abit, eo
restrictius. Si jus naturae merum spectamus, maximus feror
in eo esse videtur ιιι suum quisque consequatur, qnod (irasci
dicunt ἕκαστον ἔχειν τὰ ἑαυτοῦ, et proinde videtur ambigue
positorum interpretatio eo ducenda, utqui justa arma habuit
id consequatur ob quae arma sumsit, et damna sumtusque
recuperet: nou item ιιι paenae nomine quicquam lucretur, id

arisae, has always its effecte by Natural Law3 in so far that it cannot
be taken away, except either from canses which belong to the very
nature ot* ownership, or arise out of tha act of the owners.

X. But this consideration, that tho property of private parties is
not to be given up, except on the ground of public utility, regards the
king and his subjects; the other consideration, respecting compensa·
tion t'or loss, regards the stato and individuale. For as regards stran-
gers who contraet with the king, the aut of the king is sufficient3 not
only on account of the presumption of due authority which the dignity
of the person implies3 but also from the Lawof Nations, which allows
the goods of subjecta to be bound by the aot of the king.

XI. 1 With regard to the interpretation of conventione ot⁴ peaec,
we must observa what has been delivered above that3 in proportion
as any conditionis more favourable, it is to bc taken moro loosely:
in proportion aa it is the contrary, more restrictodly. tf we regard
mere Natural Law, the most favourable condition seems to ba, that
each shall obtain his own: and therefore the interpretation of doubt·
ful expressions is to be drawn to that sense3 that ho who has taken
up arms justly, shall obtain that for which he went to war, and reeorer
his losses and expcnses; hut not that ho shall obtain anythiug under
tlte plea of penalt53 for that is more odious.
