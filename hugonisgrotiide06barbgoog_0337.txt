330 DE FIDE PUBLIOA Qua BELLUM FINITUR, [Lm. ΙΙΙ.

clausi sunt: nem temporariam incessionem ιιι per stativa hio
amun non spectari. Demosthenes pro Ctesiphonte festinatum aita
Philippo, ut quoe posset loca occuparet, gnarus utres erat,
pacis confecto negotio, retenturum se quae teneret. Incorpo-
ralia nou tenentur nisi per res, quibus adhaerent, ut servitutes
. praediorum, aut per personas querum sunt, dum ne in solo
quod hostium fuit exercenda sint.

XIII. In altero illo paciscendi genere, quo restituitur
possessio bello turbata, notandum est, ultimam, quae aute bel·
lum fuit, possessionem respici, ita tamen ut privatis dejectis
interdicto aut vindicatione apud judicem experiri liceat

XIV. At si quis sui juris populus sponte se bellantium
alteri subjecerit, ad eum restitutio non porrigetur, ut quae sd
ea tenttmr pertineat, quae vi, metu facta sunt, aut alioqui et
dolo non nisi in hostem licito. Sic pace inter Graecos The-
bani iPlateam retinuerunt, dicentes: οὑ βίᾳ ἀλλ’ ὁμολογίᾳ
αὐτῶν προσχωρησάντων, rol ori προδόντων, ἔχειν vd χωρίον·

tected by fortifications ; for a temporary occupatIon, or an eneamp-
ment, is not here regarded. Demosthenes says that Philip made haste
to occupy what places he could, hunwing that when peace was mede,
he would keep what he held. Incorporeal possessIons are not held,
except by means of the thing to which they adhere3 as the servitudes
of lands; or by the persons to whom they belong, provided they are
not such as are to be exercised in the soil which had been the enemy's;
[for theu they go with the soil].

XIII. In the other kind of pacification, the statae quo ente bellurn,
it is ιο be noted that the last possession which preceded the war is
meent3 but in such a wey, that private eneroachments are ιο be set
aside by an order of court, or sentence of a judge, when it can be had.

XIV. But if any ponpis, which is its own master, bas, of its own
free will‚subjected itself to one of the belligerent parties, the restitu-
tion is not ιο be extended to it, since the restitutieu applies ιο those
things which are done by force or scer, or by some stratagem lawful
towards nn enemy. So when tho Greeks made peace, the Thebans
retained Platean ; saying, that they bod ιιοι toton ιι by scrcc, nor by tree-
cicry, but by tte srcc will of ibose whose it was. And on the like
grounds, Nissen remained in the possession of tho Atheniens. Τ. Quinc·
