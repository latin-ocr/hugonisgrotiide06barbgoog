cessum. Nam Argivi non fugati ab Othryade, sed socrosancta
superveniente abierant, victores se rati et id suis renuntiaturi.

Neque Comnthios fugaverant Corcyraei, sed Corinthii, cum ppqqyas

feliciter pugnassent, Atheniensium classem validam conspicati,
nullo cum Atheniensibus virium periculo facto, cessim ierant.
Philippus vero Macedo Attali quidem navem asuis desertam
ceperat, at classem nihil minus quam fugaverat Itaque, ut
Polybius notat, magis pro victore se gerebat, quam victorem ιιιιιιι ”iiiia

sunt, res manet eo locoque ante praelium fuit: et aut ad
bellum, autad novas pactiones veniendum est.

that in all the three, the parties separated without a real victory. The
Argives, in Herodotus, were not put ιο flight by Othryades, but vent
away on night coming on, thinking themselves victorious, and carried
that news to their friends. Nor did the corcyreans in Thucydides
put to flight the Corinthiam but the Corinthiam, when they had car-
ried on the combat successfully, seeing the fleet of the Atheniens

· approach in force, retreatcd without trying their strength with it. Ῑιι
Polybius, Philip of Macedon took indeed the ship of Attalus when it
had been deserted by its crew, but was very far from haring put ιο
ssight his fleet3 aud therefore, as Polybius says, he rather bore himself
as victor, thau thought himself victorious.

3 'l'hose proceedings, of collecting the spoils, granting the bodies
of tho dead for sepulture, provolsing the edversary ιο renew the battle,
which, in the places Just quoted, and in Livy, you sometimes tlnd put
forwerda as signs of victory, of themselves prove nothing; except so far
as they go along with other iudicatione to prove the ssight of the

supposed to have run away. But when there is no clear proof of
rictory, the' matter romains in the condition in which it was before
