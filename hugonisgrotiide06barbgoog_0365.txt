LI. Sed sunt tamen et deditiones conditionata, quoe aut
singulis consulunt⁸‚ ιιι quibus rita salva, aut corporum libertas,
eut et quaedam bona excipiuntur; aut etiam universitati:
quarum nonnulla etiam mixtum quoddam imperium possunt

LII. Accessiones pactionum sunt obsides et pignore.
mObsides diximus dari aut sua voluntate, aut ejus qui imperium
habet: nam in summo civili imperio comprehenditur et jus in
actiones subditorum, ιιι in bona. Sed civitas aut ejus rector
tenebitur illud incommodum ei, qui patitur, aut proximis re-
pensare; et si plures sint, quorum quis obses erat, reipublice
nihil intersit, danda opera videtur, ιιι sorte res dirimatur. In

habet: neque enim reverentia et obsequium, quae debet, huc

usque pertingunt
LIII. Interfici obsidem posse diximus per jus gentium
externum non otiam interno jure, nisi par ipsius culpe acec-

interests of individuals3 so that their lires, or liberties, or goods, are
excepted; or of the whole body; and some such conventione may
even gire rise to a mixed authority between the partice3 of which we
hare elsewhere spoliem

LII. Hostages and Pledgee are accessories to conventione. Hoe-
tages, as we hare said, are given either by their own will, or the will
of him who has authority over them. For in a supreme ciril sove-
reignty, is comprehended a right orer the actions of subjecte, as well ae
their goods. But the state, or ite ruler, will he bound to malie compen-
sation for the inconvenienoe ιο ιιο person who suffers, or his near
relations. And if there ero several persons, among whom it makes no
difference to tho stato which is the hostaga it appears proper that the
matter should be settled by lot. A russel, except he be a subject also,
is not liable to such a right on the part of the seignior: for the
reverence and obedienoe which he owes his lord do not go so far as
