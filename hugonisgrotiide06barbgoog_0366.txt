jure cautum est, ut bona eorum in fiscum cogantur. ¹15 proma.

LIV. An lugere obsidi liceat, quaritur? et constat nouato
licere, si ab initio ant postea, quo laxius haberetur, fidem de·
derit. Alioqui videtur non is animus fnisse ciuitatis obligandi
civem ne aufugeret, sed hosti dandi facultatem qualis vehet
custodire. Et sic defendi potest Oloeliae factum. Sed etsi.ipsauv.n1a
nihil peccaverat, ncivitas tamen recipere et retinere obsidem
non poterat Sic Porsenna: ei non dedatur obses, pro rupto nice-21²

LV. Odiosa autem est obsidum obligatio, tum qnia liber·
tati inimica, turn quia ex iacto alieno veuit. Ideoque stricta
interpretatio hic locum habet: quare in unam caumm dati, in
eham retineri non poterunt: qnod ita intellige, si alind quid
sine obsidum accessione promissum sit At siin alia causa
fides jam violata sit, aut contractum debitum, jam poterit

LIV. It is mado a question, whether it is lawful for a hostage to
make his escape. And it appears plainly that it is not lawfui, if, either
at first, or afterwards, he have given his word, in order to he in looser
custcdy. Without such a condition, it would seem that the state had
not the intention of binding its citizen not tc escape, but ol giving tho
enemy the power cf keeping him as they chose. And in this way, the
act of Olelia may be defended But although she had not been in
fauit, the city could not receive and keep the hostagc. So Porsenna:
If tte mauge were aot picco ap, hewoald hold the traoty hohen: and sc
tte Rouana qaue etp tie pledge ospeocs according to tto troam.

LV. However,the obligation of hostages is odious ; both mocuse
it is against liberty, and because it punishes a person for what another
has donc. Therefore, iu auch emes, a strict interpretation isapplicable.
And thus, persons given up cn one account cannot be retained on
another: which is to be understood with this condition, If anything
else be promised without the stipulaticn ol hostages. But if, in the
other cause, saith hare been violated, cr a debt contracted, the hostcge
may then be retained; not as a hostuge, but by thet part of the Low
of Nations by which subjecto may be demined ior the act of their
