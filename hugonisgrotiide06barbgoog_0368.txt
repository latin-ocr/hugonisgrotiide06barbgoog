sunt efficere, utin principalium interpretatione a regula rece-
datur: cjus autem naturam et ipsa sequi debent.

LVIII. Obiter hoc addendum est, obsides interdum noa
accessionem esse obligationis, sed revera partem principalem:
ut cum quis ex contractu factum promittit non suum, et quia,
eo non praestito, tenatur ad id quod interest, ejus vice obsides
obligantur: quam fuisse videri sentent ram Caudinae sponsionis

diximus alibi. Non dura taut um, scd et iniqua cst sententia &⁵3¹¹ ¹&

existimantium, obsidcs etiam sine consensu suo alterum exfflb ⁰th
Iacto alterius posse obligari.

LIX. Pignora quaedam eommunia habent cum obsidibus,
quaedam propria. Commune, quod et ex alio jam debito re-
tinentur, nisi obstet data fides: proprium, quod ques de iis
est pactio, non tam stricte sumitur, quam illa de obsidibus:
nequeenim aequale estodium Res enim natae sunt, ut te·
neantur, non et homines.

LX. Illud alibi quoque diximus, nullum tempus id elli· Lib-itaut
cere posse, ne luitio sit pignoris, si id praestetur, pro quo pig-
nus suppositum est. Nam qui actus causam veterem et notem
habet, non creditur ex nora procedere. Ideo patientia debi-

LVlII. This however may be added in passing: that sometimes
the hostagcs are not an‘ecoessory part of the obligatIon, but really a
prinoIpal part: as when any one, by contract, promises something to
be done by another: and, that not being performed is held to the
amount of intereat involved in the agreement ς then his hostages are
bound in his place; which was the doctrine held in the Caudina eon·
vention, as we have elsewhere stated. The opinion of those who hold
that hostages are bound for oue another's acts, eren without their own
consent, is hard and unjust.

LIX. Pledges hare some points ia common with hosteges, some,
peculiar. It is common to the two, that being given for one thing,
they may be retained for another, except a stipulation to the contrary
have been made. And it is peculiar to Pledges, that the covenant
which' rs mado concerning them‚' rs not te be taken so strictly as that ι
concaming hostages: for things are made, to be held aa property} j(
men are not. W)

LX We have also said elsewhere, that no period of time can
supersede the obIIgation of restoring the pledge, if that be done to
secure which the pledge was deposited. For an act which has an old
and known caussis not to be bellered to come from a new one.
Theresore the forbearance of the debtor [who deposited the pledge]
