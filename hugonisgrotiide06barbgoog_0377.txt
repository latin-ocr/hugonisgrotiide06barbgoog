that is, everything that is done against an enemy. Everything of that
kind is, in time of truce, against the Low of Nations ; as L. Emilius
says in his speech to the soldiors in Livy.

2 Even things belonging to the enemy, which have, by any chance,
come into our hands, are to be restored; and this, even if they had
previously been aurs: because, so far as regards external right, by
which such things aro to be judged, tliey have become theiis. And
this is the purport of what Paulus the jurist says, that in time of
truce, there is nopostliminium3 because postliminium requires that
the right of capture in war should precede; which, in time cf truce,
cannot be.

3 It is lawful to go and return on either side, but with such appa-
ratus only as shews that thero is no danger. This is remarked by
Servius upon Virgil, ditet-ique impune Lartos.- where he also relatos,
that when the city was besieged by Tarquin, and truce was rnado
between Porsenna and the Romans, when tho Circensian games were
celebrated in the city, tho leaders of the enemy entered and contested
ina chamot-racc, aad were crowned as victore.

in Livy that Philip did, is not at variance witha truce; nor to repair
