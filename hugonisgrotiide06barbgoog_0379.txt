372 Du FIDE MANENTE BELLO, [hm. 111.

IX. 1 Quaritur, an qui vi majore impeditus quo minus
recederet, intra fines hosticus deprehenditur postquam exie·
rint inducia, jus redeundi habeat? Si jus externum gentium
respicimus, non dubito quin hie parsit ei, qui cum in pace
recuset bello repente exorto inter hostes fato suo deprehen·
ditur, quem captivum manere ad pacem usque supra notavi·
mus; neque justitia interna deest, quatenus bona et actiones
hostium pro debito civitatis obligantur, et iu solutum capiun-
tur: nee magis hic quod queratur habet, quam tot alii inno·
centes, in quos bellorum mala recidunt

noemma 2 Nec quade commissi eausa circa merces tractantur
iiiic'm adferri hnc debent, nee quod apud Ciceronem est De Incen-
ffliiiff tione secundo, do nave rostrata vi ventorum in portum delata,

quam exlege quaestor publicari volebat Ibi enim vis major
a poena liberat3 hic proprie de poena non agitur, sed de jure
quod certo tantum tempore intes-quiescebat. Tamen quin
talem remittere benignius, quin et generosius sit, nullam habet
dubitationem.

cf Belisarius against the Gotho isreiuted3 for he, on such a pretence
had seized in time of truce places stripped of their garrisons.

IX. 1 It is mado a question, whether he who, being prerented by
major force* from retreating‚ is caught within the boundaries of tho
enemy aster the period of the truce has expired, has the right of
retur-ning. If wc regard the externat Law of Natious,I do not doubt
thntsuch a person is in the position of one who, having come in peace,
is, by the sudden breaking cut of war, caught by accident among ene-
mies; and we have noticed before that such a oue rcmaius a prisoner
till a peace. Nor is internal justice wanting for such aprocecding3 so
far as the goods and achone of enemies are bound for the debt of the
state, and are taken towards its paymcnt. Nor has such a person
more ground to complain, than so many other innocent persons upon
whom tho calamities of war fall.

2 Nor ought thero to be urged, on the other side, the cases of mer-
chandises which, by stress of weathcr, are carried past the place where
dues aro to hc paid‚ and which newertheless are excuscd†; nor the
caso mentioned by Cicero, of a ship of war, forced by stress of westher
into a port, where its cntcring was contrary to the law, and which tho
questos wanted to confiscate. For in these cases, the operation ot'

' Fores majcurc: force which cannot bc effectualiy resisted.
† So Gronovius understands the csse.
