X. Sunt et quaedam per inducias illicita, ob specialem
conventionis naturam: ut sitantum sepeliendorum hominnm
causa datae sint induciae, nihil erit immutandum: sio ¹si ob-
sessis datae inducias tantum ne oppugnemus, jam auxilia et
commeatus admittere non licebit: nam cum tales induciae altori
partium prosint, non debent interim ojus, qui dedit, causam
duriorem iacere. Interdum et convenit, ne commeare liceat.
¹¹¹Interdum personis cavetur, non atrebas: quo casn si ad res
defendendas loedantnr personae, nihil contra inducias fiet:
nam cnm liceat res defendere, personarum securitas ad id
quod principale est, non qnod in alicujus consequentiam venit,
referenda est.

XI. Si fides induciarum a parte altera rumpatur, quin
laeso liberum sit etiam sine indictione ad arma venire, frustra
dubitetur: nam capita conventionis insunt conventioni per
modum conditionis, ut paulo anto diximus. Reperias quidem zpptp.

[of war], which was quiescent only during a certain interval of time.
But thet to remit such rights is merc humane, and also more gene-
rons, admits of no doubt.

X. There are also some things which are nnlawfnl during a truce,
in consequence of the special nature of the consention: as iia ιιιιοο
is granted, only ior the seire οι burying the dead, nothing is to be
changed: and if atruce is giren ιο a besieged place, only that they
are not to be assaulted, it will then not be lawiul ιο admit aid and
provisions: for since such a truce is giren es an advantage to one of
the parties, it ought not ιο damage the position of him who granted
it. Sometimes also it is stipulated, that it shall not be lawful for
personato pass between the parties. Sometimes such passage is
granted ιο persons, but not ιο things: in which case, ii persons are
hurt in resisting tho passage of things, the truce is not broken. For
sinos it is lawful to opposs the passage oi things, the security of per-
