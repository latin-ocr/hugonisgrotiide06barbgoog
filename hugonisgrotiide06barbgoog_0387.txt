XXVI. Et potest idem pluribus debere pretium, si eb
uno dimissus, pretio nondum soluto, eaptus sit ab alio: sunt
enim diversa haec debita ex dirersis causis.

XXVII. Conventio de pretio facta rescindi non potest,
eo quod captus intelligatur locupletior quam credebatur: quia
jure gentium externo, de qno quaerimus, nemo cogitur sup·
plere quod in contractu minus aequo pretio promisit, si dolus
non intercessit: nt intelligi potest ex his qnae de contractibus

Μ XXVIII. Er eo, quod diximus captivos nostros serres

non esse, sequitur cessare illam acquisitionem universalem,
ruerus. quam accessionem esse dominii m personam diximus alibi.

ι Non alia ergo captori acquirentur quam quae specialiter appre-
henderit: quare siquid clam secum habetcaptivus,nonerit
acquisitum, qnia. nec possessum. Sicut Paulus jurisconsultus

epm ιιι contra Brutum et Manilium respondit, qm fundum possessione

leidigin cepit, thesaurum, quem in l'nndo esse nesciat, non cepisse:
⁹⁰⁸⁸ quia qni nescit nequeat possidere. Coi consequens est, ut res

XXVII. Tho agreement concerning the amount of ransom, can·
not be rescinded on account of tho prisoner being discovered to bo
richer than ho was supposed to be: because, by tho ertornel Law of
Nations, which is tho subjectos our present enquIry, no ono is com·
pclled to gire more than he promised in a contract, at a price different
from the sument price, if thero hee been no deecit: as may be under-
stood from what we heve said about Contracts.

XXVIII. From what we hare said, that prisoners with us ere not
slaves, it follows that thoro Ie en end οι that acquisition of a right
over all thet belongs to the person, as well es tho person ; for that this
is a moro accessory to tho power orer the person, wo have elsewhere
said. Thorefore nothing eleo becomes the property of thc captor,
but what he specially takes possession of. And therefore, if the
prisoner has anything secroted with him, that is not acquired by the
captor, because it was never in his possession. So Paulus the jurist
gave his opinion against Brutus and Manilius, that he who came into
possession of a piece of land, did not acquIro possession of a treasuro
