Cur. XXX] UBI DE INDUOIIS, COMMEATU, ETO. 381

XXIX. 1 Quaeri et hoc solet, an pretium conventum et
ante mortem non solutum ab herede debeatur. Expedita
mihi videtur responsio, siin carcere mortuus est, non deberi:
promisso enim inerat conditio, si liberaretur: mortuus autem
non liberatur. Contra, si mortuus est cum in libertate esset,
deberi. Jam enim lucratus erat id, pro quo promissum eret

retium.
p 2 Plane fateor et aliter conveniri posse, ut abipso con·
tractus momento pure debeatur pretium, et captivus tantum
retinentur, non jem ut jure belli captus, sed ut ase oppigno-
rntus: et contra pactum iniri posse, ut procedet pretii solutio,
ai die praestituto, qni captus sit, liber vivat. Sed haeo ut
minus naturalia non praesumuntnr acta, nisi manifestis docu-
mentis. ν

ΧΧΧ. Proponitur et illud, nn in carcerem redire debent,
qui dimissus est sub pacto, ut faceret dimitti alterum, qui

fectum morte praevenerit. Diximus alibi, factum tertii libe· telligit,

raliter promissum satis impleri, si nihil omittitur ex parte mg

promissoris; et in onerosis obligari promissorem ad id, quod

could not be the possessor of it. From which it follows, that property
ao concealed may be applied ιο furnish the amount of ransom the
ownership haring been retained by the prisoner.

XXIX. 1 This is else a frequent question: whether the ransom
agreed upon, and not paid before death, be due from the heir. The
answer appears ιο ιιιο ιο ιο obvious, if the prisoner die in captivity‚
that it is not due: for the promise was, on the condition that the
prisoner should be liberated, and a dead man is not liberated. On
the other hand, if he dies when heis at liberty, it is due; for he
had already got the thing for which the price was promised.

2 1 undoubtedly confess that the agreement may be mede other-
wise,s0 thet, from the moment of the contraet, the price may be abeo·
luteiy due, and the prisoner may ιο retained, not now as e prisoner
of war, but as a pledge given by himself: and on the other hand, that
it may be coronanted that the payment of the price shall take place,
if on a certain appointed day, ho who is captive, be alive and free.
But such conditione, as being less natnrnl, ere not ιο ιο presumed,
except upon manifest evidence.

XXX. This question also is propoundedr whether he ought ιο
return into captivity, who was set free, on the compact thet he should
cause ruotberto be liberated, who, by dying, presented that being
done. We hare elsewhere said that the liberal promise of ethird
person is fultllled with sufficient eructuass, if nothing be omitted on
