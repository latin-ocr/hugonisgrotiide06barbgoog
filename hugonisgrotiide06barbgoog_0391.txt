384· Dlll FIDE MINORUM POTESTATUM [lala. Ill.

11. Est autem in herum promissis duplex inspectio: nam
aut hoc quaeritur, an summam potestatem obligent, aut aa se
ipses. 'Prior questio delinienda estex eo, quod alibi diximus,
obligari nos et per eum quem uoluntatis nostrae ministrum
elegerimus, sive uoluntas illa specialiter expressa est, sire ex
ipsa praepositionis natura colligitur. Nam qui dat laculta·
tem, dat quantum iu se est quas ad facultatem suut necessaria,
quod in materia morali intelligendum est morali modo. Duo·
bus ergo modis potestates minores supremam suo lacto obstrin-
gunt, faciendo id quod probabiliter ipsorum officio contineri
censetur, aut etiam extra illud ex speciali praepositione note
publice, antiis quorum res agitur.

lll. Sunt etalii modo, quibus potestas summa obligatur
antecedente ministrorum sacto, sednon ita, ut id sactum causa
sit proprie dieta, sed ut occasio sit obligationis: idque dupli-
citer, vel per consensum, vel per rem ipsam. Censensus ap·
paret ratihabitione, non tautum expressa, sed et tacita, id cst,
ubi seivit summa potestas quod aetum erat, et fieri passa eat,
qua ad aliam causam referri probabiliter nou possunt3 qued

11. The promises of Officers of this kind gire rise to two kinds of
consideratione: Whether they bind the supreme authority3 and
whether they bind themselves. The former question is to he decidcd
by what we hare said; that we are bound by his acts whom we hare
selected as the ministerus our will, whether that will be specially
expressed, or be collected from the nature of the command committed
to him. For he who gives the means of acting, gives, as far aa
depende on him, the means which are necessary to such action: which,
in moral matters, is to be understood in a moral manner. Therefore
there are two ways in which subordinate authorities bind the
supreme authority by their acts: either by doing that which, on pro·
hablu grounds is eonceired to be included in their office; or beyond
that, committed to them by some special assignment of authority,
known to these whose interests are dealt with.

ΙΙΙ. There are also other ways in which the supreme authority
is bound, in virtue of an antecedent act of its miniscere, but so that
that act is not, properly speaking, the cause os the obligation, but the
occasion; and that, in two ways; either by consent of the superior,
or by the thing itself. Conscnt appears by sanction of the act; not
express only, but tacit als03 that is,wl1en the supreme authority knew
