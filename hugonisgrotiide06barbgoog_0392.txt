what was done, and allowed it to be done ι and in this case, if no other
reason [besides censent] can bo probably assIgned, we have elsewhere
stated what course the matter must take. The superior authority are
obliged by the thing itself te this extent3 that they are not to be
made better eff by the loss of other persons ; thetis, that they are
either to fulfil the eontraet by which they wish ιο obtain an advantage,
or are to giro up the advantag03 a case of equity which we have
elsewhere discussod. And ιο far, and no further, acts which are
performed so as ιο bring utility te ns, ιιι ιο be said to be solid. On
the other hand, they ιιιιιιοι be exeusad from tho charge of injustice,
who, while they condemn tho compact, retain that which without the
cempaet they would not hersa aa when the Roman Senate neither
could approve the sot of Gn. Domitius, ner would reseind it: of which
kind of occurrence we have many in history.

IV. 1 We must also repeat what we have said before, that he
who placed a person in a command, is bound, ewen though the person
so placed acts against secret orders; at least, within the limita of his
public function. This ruls of equity was rightly followed by tho
Roman Praetor, in the action against an Agent3 for it is not ererything
done by the Agant which obliges the Principal, bnt such things only as
are contractae in the matter for which his ageney was employed3 but
he concerning whom public notice was given, ι1ιιι contracta with him
would net be held good by the Principal, does not stand in the place
