386 DE FIDE MINORUM POTESTATUM [lnam.

bitur ἐ quod si proscriptum quidem sit, sed non pateat, tenetur
qui praeposuit: conditio quoque praepositionis servanda est:
nam si quis sub certo lege vel interventu cujusdam personae
contrahi voluit, aequissimum erit id senari, in quo prepositus
m 2 cui consequens est, nt alii reges ant populi magis, alii

minus ex ducum suorum eonnactibus teneri possint, si satis
notae sint ipsorum leges atque instituta. De his si non constat,
- sequendum estquod conjecturo dictat, ut conoessum intelliga-
tur id, sine quo satis commode, quae officii sunt, expediri non
possunt.

3 Mandati ¹fines si excesserit minor potestas, tenebitur
ipsa, si quod promisit prestare non potest, ad aestimationem:
nisi lex aliqua satis cognita id quoque impediat. Quod si
dolus accesserit, id est, si pne se tulerit jus majus quam habe-

that the contract should bo valid on these conditione.

2 From which it follows, that sorno kings and pcoples may be more,
and others less bound, by the contracte of their generals, if their laws
and rules are sufficiently known. If these are not commonly known,
the interpretation must be followed which conjecture dictates3 in
such away that that is understood to be conceded without which
tho fonctions which belong to a person’s duty cannot be conveniently
carried out.

mission, he will be bound, if he cannot perform what it has promised,
to an estimated equivaleut: except some law sufficiently known pre·

authority gremer than ho had, ho will thou bo bound, both for the
damage done by his fault, and as a criminol, to tho penalty eorre-

if thoy are insufficiens, his laborm, or his personui liberty: on tho
second ground, his person also is liable, or his goods, or both, accord-
