2 At nondum quesita condonare omnino in ducum est

IX. 1 In the same way, it is not the business of generals to give up
men, conquesta, landa, obtained in war. By this rulo, Syria was talren
from Tigranes, though Lucullus had gisen it to him. of Sophonisba,
who had been taken prisoner in war, Scipio says that the judgment

that therefore Masinissa, though the general by whom she was taken,
could not give her liberty. That orer other things which are taken
as prize oi war, a certain disposal is concedcd to persons in authority,
we have seen; not so much from the force oi their power, as from the
customs oi each people: on thch subject we hare already spoken
sufficiently.

2 Itis however in the power oi generals to grant the possession
of things not yet acquired: because towns sometimes and men often
surrender themselves in war, on condition ci lives being spared, or
liberty, or property ; among which concessione generally, the state oi
things does not allow the decision oi the supreme authority to be
asked. And by purity ci reason, this right is also given to commandens
who are nottho highest, within the limita oi the matters which are
committed to tham to executa. Maharbal had given to some Romans
who had escaped from the battle at Trasimenum, Annibal being absent
