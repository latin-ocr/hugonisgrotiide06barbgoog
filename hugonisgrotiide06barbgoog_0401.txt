394 DE FIDE PRIVATA IN BELLO. [Lus. 111.

recedendi, si id, qnod per errorem creditum tuit, in mente
agentis vim habuerit conditionis.

V. 1 Αι, quo usqne se extendat privatorum in pacis-
cendo potestas, difficilior inspectio est. Quod publicum est, a
privato alienari non posse satis constat: nam si ne ducibus

vetustte· quidem belli id permissum est, ut modo probavimus, multo
minus privatis. Sed de ipsorum actionibus ao robus quaeri
potest, quia videntur haec qnoque concedi hostibus non posse
sine aliquo damno partis: unde wideri possunt talia pecta
illicita oum civibus ob jus supereminens civitatis, tum conductis
militibus ob fidem sacramento datam.

2 Sed sciendum est, aspecta, quse malum majus aut cer-
tius evitant, magis utilia quam damnose etiam publico censeri
debere, quia minus melum induit rationem boni: χρὴ τῶν
subdu ἐπιλέγεσθαι wd μετριώτερα, ut ait quidam apud

moeste Appianum. Neque vero fides sola, qusquis potestatem ipsam
sui et sumum rerum non abdicat, neque utilitas publiea sine
legis anctoritate id efficere possunt, ut quod factum est, etiamsi
contre officium factum esse detur, irritum sit ct effectu juris

dition.

cannot be alienated by a private person, is sufficiently plain: for if
that was not even permitted ιο generals, as wo have proved just now,
much less is it to private persons. But it may be questioned concern·
ing their own actions und property3 because it may seem that those
nlso cannot ιο conceded to the enemy without some damage of the
party: whence it may seem that such pecte with the enemy are
unlawful for citizens, on account of tho eminent jurisdiction of tho
stete ; and for regular soldiers‚ on account of their military ooth.

2 But it is to ιο considered that those pects which are made in
order to avoid a greater or certain evil, ought to be reokoncd more
useful than hurtful to the public also; because tho leesor evil assumes
the nature of a good. N or does fidelity to tho state or his superior3
since by this the person does not abdicato his power over himself end
his property; nor does the publio utility alone, without tho authority
of lew3 produce such an effect, that what is done, ewen if it be done
against duty, shall be void and destitute of jural effect.

3 Law indeed may take from subjecte, either perpetual or tem-
