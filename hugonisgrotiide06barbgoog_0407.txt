1. Itis well said by Javolenuo, that some things aro agreed upon in
silence. This happens inpublic conventione, and in private, and in mixed.
Tho caussis this3 that consent, however indicated and accepted, has
the force of transferring right. But there are other signs of consent,
besides words and letters, as we have more than once indicated.

II. Some are by nature inherent in certain acts. For an example,
take him who coming from the enemy, or from strangers‚ gives him·
self into the hands of another people or iring. For that such aper-
son tacitly binde himself not to do anything against that state in which
he secks refuge, cannot bo doubted. Wherofore they are not to be
followed, who say that the act of Zopyrus was free from blame: for
his fidelity to his king does not excusabis perfidy towards those to
whom ho fied. The same must be said of Sextum the same of Tar-
quin who went over to Gabii. Virgil speaks of Sinon’s treachery and
crrmo.
